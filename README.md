## Day 0
* Co-ordinated group on Slack
* Set up shared github repo
* Signed up for OpenWeather API key

## Day 1
* Explored the data from the OpenWeather API calls with Postman
* Hooked up the button to fetch OpenWeather data

## Day 2
* Added in functionality for 5-day forecast data
* Encountered errors in js, and tried to fix them as it was breaking the whole thing

## Day 3
* Fixed the js issues, and got 5-day forecast data working again
* Learned about working collaboratively on github processes, and staying in sync
* Explored some of the ideas to expand upon initial demo in our individual feature branches:
    * Making the experience responsive
    * Background changes according to weather type
    * Icons change to show what clothing is weather appropriate for the day
* Presented our demo to the rest of the class

We ran out of time to fully implement these ideas, and had to present our demo as it was.
* Static background image, logo changed
* Weather data: 
    * location name,
    * current weather label & description
    * temperature, humidity, and windspeed.
    * 5-day forecast data displayed underneath with icons.

## Reflections
It was a really good learning exercise on collaboration, and working on a project as a team using Github.
Good communication and keeping in sync with each other was really important. I think that with better planning, we could have worked on the design and wireframing together more at the beginning, but our priority was just to get the basic weather data pulled in with the API and figuring out the Javascript side of things.

Towards the end, on the last day we saw that Jigna had been working on some really impressive features on her own branch, but we didn't have time to polish them and merge them into the main branch to demo.
