## Day 0
* Co-ordinated group on Slack
* Set up shared github repo
* Signed up for OpenWeather API key

## Day 1
* Explored the data from the OpenWeather API calls with Postman
* Hooked up the button to fetch OpenWeather data

## Day 2
* Added in functionality for 5-day forecast data
* Encountered errors in js, and tried to fix them as it was breaking the whole thing

## Day 3
* Fixed the js issues, and got 5-day forecast data working again
* Learned about working collaboratively on github processes, and staying in sync
* Explored some of the ideas to expand upon initial demo in our individual feature branches:
    * Making the experience responsive
    * Background changes according to weather type
    * Icons change to show what clothing is weather appropriate for the day
* Presented our demo to the rest of the class

We ran out of time to fully implement these ideas, and had to present our demo as it was.
* Static background image, logo changed
* Weather data: 
    * location name,
    * current weather label & description
    * temperature, humidity, and windspeed.
    * 5-day forecast data displayed underneath with icons.
